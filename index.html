            <h2 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">The game</h2>
            <p class="mb-4"> In the game there are three piles of cards which show six possible weapons, six possible
              murderers, and ten possible rooms. One card from each pile is selected at random and secretly to be what
              will be referred to as the three “correct" cards which the players will try to deduce. Then the rest of
              the cards are randomly split between the players to give them an initial set of cards that they can
              already consider not to be in the correct set.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4"> When playing the game the players then take turns
              “suspecting" combinations of murderers, weapons, and rooms. In response to this question each player takes
              turns to either say if they do not have one of the cards that were suspected, or if they do, secretly show
              that card to the suspecting player and then the turn ends. Once a player believes that they know the
              hidden stack of cards, they can accuse that set and check for themselves if they are correct. If they are
              wrong, they return the stack and are out of the game, otherwise they win.

            <h2 class="tm-text-color-white mb-4">The Idea</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white"> Create a Cluedo simulator, where the user can see the knowledge
              (Kripke) model of the current state of the game. As the game progresses, the Kripke model will be updated
              accordingly. The game is played between AI agents.
            </p>
            <h2 class="tm-text-color-white mb-4">Simplifications</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white"> Our game will not include movement between rooms and there is no
              restrictions on the questions that an agent can ask on their turn. The game is played with fewer cards
              (weapons, rooms & agents) to reduce the number of Kripke worlds.

            <p class="mb-4">
            <ul>
              <li><u>Cluedo implementation</u>: The main requirement of this project is that implementation of the game
                Cluedo (rules, cards etc.). The simplifications mentioned above are made, to limit the number of
                possible worlds.</li>
              <li><u>AI agents</u>: Another core requirement is the implementation of AI agents that can interact with
                the game. The agents should at least be able to play randomly/without a strategy</li>
              <li><u>Knowledge Model</u>: A Kripke Model should be created representing the knowledge of each agent with
                regards to the location of the cards (cards in the centre & cards in the agents’ hands)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-4">
            <ul>
              <li><u>Step button</u>: The user should be able to interact with the simulation through a ‘step’ button
                that
                progresses the game by 1 step</li>
              <li><u>1st & 2nd order knowledge</u>: Depending on the order of knowledge, agents can adapt the Kripke
                model
                differently (2nd order knowledge agents can infer more). This is explained later in more detail</li>
              <li><u>Metrics</u>: After each simulation, it should be possible to see how the knowledge of each agent
                progresses through the game (in terms of number of worlds) and which agent won</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4" , style="text-align:center">Could have</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">
            <ul>
              <li><u>Kripke model access</u>: An extension of the game is for the user to be able to access the Kripke
                model
                during the game (e.g. through queries)</li>
              <li><u>UI</u>: A visual user interface could allow the user to more easily interact with the programme,
                allowing them to access more information at the same time</li>
              <li><u>Automatic simulations</u>: It is useful to offer the possibility for the user to run a number of
                simulations/complete games automatically, exporting the results at the end</li>
              <li><u>User as a player</u>: Offering the possibility to the user to also participate in the game could be
                a fun extension of the software</li>
              <li><u>Guessing Agents</u>: It could be interesting for an agent to take a guess when they have a high
                certainty (e.g. 50% chance that their guess is right). This increases the realism of the simulation</li>

            <p class="mb-4">The model’s foundation is a Kripke model that is shared among all agents. Naturally, the two
              main elements of the model are the worlds/states and the accessibility relations between states.<br>
              1. Worlds/States: Each world contains a set of atomic propositions. There are two types of propositions:
              1) Propositions describing what is in the hidden stack(e.g. “w_1” entails that weapon 1 is in the hidden
              stack) and 2) Propositions describing what is in agents’ hands (e.g. “c_{w_1}” entails agent c has weapon
              1)
              <br>
              2. Accessibility relations: As per usual, the accessibility relations model what each agent considers to
              be a possibility. Depending on the inference-capacity of each agent, different accessibility relations are
              removed/changed after every round.

            <p class="mb-4">We will use the MESA (for the MAS aspect) and MLSolver (for building and updating the Kripke
              model) packages. The solve function from the MLSolver function uses a function that generates the powerset
              of all worlds. As our model will contain a significant number of words, we need to code our own
              implementation of the function, as using the existing one is too computational expensive for our
              application (for more than a few worlds). As the user inputs the data, MESA will be used to track the
              game’s state and decide what information is needed next and in the event of user input we will update the
              kripke model through ml solver. At any point, the user will be able to query the ML solver model using
              epistemic logic formulae.
