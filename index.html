            <p class="mb-4"> Cluedo is a mystery-solving board game. By moving around the rooms and asking questions to
              others, players investigate a murder. Specifically, they try to discover who was the murderer, with what
              weapon the murder was commited, and in what room the murder took place. The investigator who uncovers the 
              mystery first, wins the game.</p>

            <h2 class="tm-text-color-white mb-4">The Idea</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white"> Create a Cluedo simulator, where the user can see the knowledge
              (Kripke) model of the current state of the game. As the game progresses, the Kripke model will be updated
              accordingly. The game is played between AI agents.
            </p>
            <h2 class="tm-text-color-white mb-4">The Research Question</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white"> How is the win-rate and knowledge base of an agent affected by their
              use of higher order knowledge?
            </p>
            <h2 class="tm-text-color-white mb-4">Simplifications</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white"> Our game will not include movement between rooms and there are no
              restrictions on the questions that an agent can ask on their turn. The game is played with fewer cards
              (weapons, rooms & agents) to reduce the number of Kripke worlds.
            </p>

            <h2 class="tm-text-color-white mb-4">The Game Process</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white">
            <ol class="whiteList">
              <li>1 card from each category is chosen to be hidden in the middle (3 cards in total)</li>
              <li>Cards are dealt to the players: For each category (people, weapons & rooms), the remaining cards are
                distributed for all agents. When the cards in the category run out, cards of the next category are
                dealt, starting with the player where we left off.</li>
              <li>Once the cards are dealt, the first round of the game starts: The first player asks a question
                consisting of a request for a person, weapon and room. The other agents, in order, have to show to the
                asking player one of the cards they were asked about (if they have it), or pass if they don't have any
                of the cards they were asked about. If a player shows a card to the asking player or if all players have
                none of the cards they were asked about, the round ends.</li>
              <li>Similar to the previous round, the next player can now ask a question and the remaining of the round
                follows the same rules. </li>
              <li>Once a player considers that they know enough about which 3 cards are in the middle, they can win by
                accusing the 3 hidden cards in their round. If the accusing player is right with their accusation, they
                win the game. If their accusation is incorrect, they are eliminated from the game and their cards remain
                hidden (the eliminated player cannot show any cards to the other players).</li>
              <li>In case of a false accusation, the game simply continues until a player makes the correct accusation
                (in case everyone makes a wrong accusation, everyone loses).</li>

            <p class="mb-4">
            <ul>
              <li><u>Cluedo implementation</u>: The main requirement of this project is that implementation of the game
                Cluedo (rules, cards etc.). The simplifications mentioned above are made, to limit the number of
                possible worlds.</li>
              <li><u>AI agents</u>: Another core requirement is the implementation of AI agents that can interact with
                the game. The agents should at least be able to play randomly/without a strategy</li>
              <li><u>Knowledge Model</u>: A Kripke Model should be created representing the knowledge of each agent with
                regards to the location of the cards (cards in the centre & cards in the agents’ hands)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">Should have</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">
            <ul>
              <li><u>Step button</u>: The user should be able to interact with the simulation through a ‘step’ button
                that
                progresses the game by 1 step</li>
              <li><u>1st & 2nd order knowledge</u>: Depending on the order of knowledge, agents can adapt their knowledege
                differently (High order knowledge agents can infer more). This is explained later in more detail</li>
              <li><u>Metrics</u>: After each simulation, it should be possible to see how the knowledge of each agent
                progresses through the game (in terms of number of worlds) and which agent won</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">Could have</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">
            <ul>
              <li><u>Kripke model access</u>: An extension of the game is for the user to be able to access the Kripke
                model
                during the game (e.g. through queries)</li>
              <li><u>UI</u>: A visual user interface could allow the user to more easily interact with the programme,
                allowing them to access more information at the same time</li>
              <li><u>Automatic simulations</u>: It is useful to offer the possibility for the user to run a number of
                simulations/complete games automatically, exporting the results at the end</li>
              <li><u>User as a player</u>: Offering the possibility to the user to also participate in the game could be
                a fun extension of the software</li>
              <li><u>Guessing Agents</u>: It could be interesting for an agent to take a guess when they have a high
                certainty (e.g. 50% chance that their guess is right). This increases the realism of the simulation</li>

              Note that each world has as many atoms as there are cards. The user is able to adapt the number of
              agents/players, rooms, weapons & people/suspects.

              <li><u>Accessibility relations</u></li> As per usual, the accessibility relations model what each agent
              considers to be a possibility. These accessibility relations are updated at each turn of the game. In 
              The Kripke model is also not initially fully connected (not all worlds have an accessibility relation 
              to every world). This is the case as, for example, an agent with the "person 1" card will not consider
              a world where "person 1" is the true murderer to be possible.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              <li><u>Computational limitations</u></li> Being able to adjust the number agents, rooms, weapons & people
              is an important aspect of the implementation, as the model is very susceptible to <i>state explosion</i>.
              The table below summarises the number of worlds & accessibility relationships for different parameter
              values. It is worth noting that this is the number of accessibility relations for a fully connected model,
              which is not possible in the real game (e.g. it is not possible for two players to have the same weapon.
              Yet, with our implementation, a fully connected model has to be created before it is reduced based on what
              is possible (this reduction is done right before the cards are dealt). Therefore, the numbers reported in
              the table more accurately describe the computational demand of our implementation.
              <br>
              In reality, it is possible (and likely) that the values of each parameter are different, leading to some
              players starting with 1 more/fewer card. The more cards are used in the game in total, the smaller the
              advantage of having an extra card. Since the simulation will only be played with a few cards, we decided
              to keep the values of the parameters equal so that no agent has a considerable advantage.

            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white"> The user can decide how many agents participate in the game. They also
              determine the number of 1st or Higher-Order knowledge agents. Perhaps counter-intuitively, first and
              higher-order knowledge agents are not separated by the type of questions they ask but rather by the
              information they can obtain from the events of the game (the inference strategies are detailed in the
              following section).
              <br><br>
              When it comes to the players' strategy, they all follow a simple greedy method to decide what question to
              ask. Specifically, they will only ask questions about weapons/rooms/people that they know might be in the
              middle. In other words, if an agent knows that a different agent has weapon 1, they will not inquire about
              it. Even so, they might still ask a question about a card that they have in their hand (this is also a
              good strategy so that the player receives more relevant information).
              <br><br>
              From all possible questions that follow these rules, players choose a question randomly.

            As mentioned previously, 1st and Higher-Order agents differ in the inferences they can make during the game.
            <br><br>
            <h4 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">1st-Order Inference</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The inference rule that 1st-order knowledge players follow is very simple: When answering agent shows
              them a card, they now know that this card is nowhere else. In order to keep track of this the 1st-order
              agents have a simple list of cards they've seen, and will consider all possibile solutions where none of
              those cards are in the middle.
            </p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">Higher-Order Inference</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Higher-order knowledge players observe also what cards other agents have and what they know. The inference 
              rules they follow are detailed below.
              <br><br>
              First, if any agent responds negatively to a question, all worlds where the answering agent has any of the 
              3 asked cards are removed. In other words, all higher order knowledge agents now know that the answering 
              agent does not have any of cards in the question.
              <br><br>
              Then, in the case where an agent A shows one of the asked cards to agent B:
            <ul>
              <li>In worlds where agent A has one of the asked cards, the accessibility relations of agent B are
                updated so that they do not consider worlds with that card outside of agent A's hand</li>
              <li>In worlds where agent A has multiple of the asked cards are duplicated, one for each of the different
                possible cards that they could have shown to agent B. For each duplicate world, agent B's accessibility
                relations are updated such that they do not consider worlds with that card outside of agent A's hand.
                Finally, create accessibility relationships between all duplicate worlds for all other higher order
                agents, as they do not know which of the cards was shown.</li>

            <p class="mb-4">To investigate the research question, an experimental setup was devised. Eight full games
              were simulated, each with 4 agents (2 1st order, 2 high order), 3 weapons, 3 people and 4 rooms. After
              each turn, the number of possible solutions each agent considers possible was recorded. At the end of the
              game, the winning agnet was recorded.
              <br>
              In each game, the first order knowledge agents played first. It is worth noting that since there are 7
              cards distributed amongst 4 players, an agent would have to start with a single card. That agent was
              chosen to be the last player, who also happens to be a higher order knowledge player.

            <p class="mb-4">
              At the start of this project, we set out to answer the research question "How is the win-rate and
              knowledge base of an agent affected by their use of higher order knowledge?".
              <br>
              Starting with the first part of the research question, we can conclude that agents that utilise higher
              order knowledge are more successful in the game. In fact, compared to the current implementation of 1st
              order knowledge agents, they remained undefeated.
              <br>
              Moreover, it is was seen that the knowledge base of higher order knowledge agents is more quickly reduced,
              leading them to win the game earlier. This was especially clear when higher order knowledge players played
              their first round.
            </p>
            <h2 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">Discussion</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The aforementioned conclusions are unsurprising to a large extent. Agents using higher order knowledge can
              not only make better inferences, but can also consequently ask more relevant questions (as they have more
              knowledge). It is quite interesting that even though higher order knowledge agents play last, they still
              always win the games. Lastly, the superiority of higher order knowledge agents is also highlighted by the
              fact that even the agent starting with only 1 card (instead of 2) outperformed 1st order knowledge agents.
              <br>
              An important limitation of this research is its small focus. Due to the time required to run each
              simulation, we were not able to simulate games similar to real Cluedo games. In the end, we chose the
              values for our parameters such that there is a good balance between copmutational complexity and
              efficiency.
              <br>
              Looking back at the requirements set out at the start of the project (3rd section of this site), we
              managed to fully implement all "must have" and "should have" requirements. When it comes to the "could
              have" requirements, a basic UI was implemented as well as an elementary access to the Kripke model. Both
              of these aspects can definitely be improved further. The remainder of the "could have" requirements are
              good ideas to extend the program, but due to the lack of time and limited added value (as they do not help
              in answering the research question) we decided to not implement them.
            </p>
            <h2 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">Future Research</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Even though this is a fairly independent project, it still has some fruitful roots for future research.
              <br>
              First, as was briefly touched upon earlier, an advantage of higher-order knowledge agents is the fact that
              they can ask more relevant questions. By extension, it is interesting to analyse how the performance
              (measure in number of possible solutions being considered) of higher order knowledge agents changes
              depending on the number of higher order knowledge agents participating in the game.
              <br>
              Another idea for future research is the comparison of the performance of 1st order knowledge agents that
              have the ability to guess when they are uncertain, versus higher order knowledge players that only make an
              accusation when they are certain of the solution. In this way, for example, if a 1st order knowledge agent
              is only 50% sure of the solution, they can accuse with 50% certainty, as waiting for a full round might be
              risky in case a higher order knowledge agent is closing in on the answer.
