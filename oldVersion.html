            <h2 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">The game</h2>
            <p class="mb-4"> In the game there are three piles of cards which show six possible weapons, six possible
              murderers, and ten possible rooms. One card from each pile is selected at random and secretly to be what
              will be referred to as the three “correct" cards which the players will try to deduce. Then the rest of
              the cards are randomly split between the players to give them an initial set of cards that they can
              already consider not to be in the correct set.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4"> When playing the game the players then take turns
              “suspecting" combinations of murderers, weapons, and rooms. In response to this question each player takes
              turns to either say if they do not have one of the cards that were suspected, or if they do, secretly show
              that card to the suspecting player and then the turn ends. Once a player believes that they know the
              hidden stack of cards, they can accuse that set and check for themselves if they are correct. If they are
              wrong, they return the stack and are out of the game, otherwise they win.

            <h2 class="tm-text-color-white mb-4">The Idea</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white"> Create a Cluedo simulator, where the user can see the knowledge
              (Kripke) model of the current state of the game. As the game progresses, the Kripke model will be updated
              accordingly. Below is a roadmap of our progress.
            </p>
            <h2 class="tm-text-color-white mb-4">Simplifications</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 tm-text-color-white"> Our game will not include movement between rooms and there is no
              restrictions on the questions that an agent can ask on their turn. We will also allow the game to include
              variable number of cards/agents as we will implement the quantities dynamically.

          <div class="tm-md-flex-center">
            <h2 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4" , style="text-align:center">The Roadmap</h2>
            <p class="mb-4"> 1.Kripke Model where the user inputs all game events as they know
              them (agent 1 asked x and agent 2 answered with ‘yes’ (and showed a card)). The Kripke model will be
              updated according to those events (if an input is impossible based on the model, the event is rejected).
              The mode is updated depending on 2 different inference-capacities: The first inference-capacity is to only
              consider information directly told to the user, such as what is in the user’s hand/what is shown to them.
              The 2nd inference-capacity involves higher order knowledge, where what other agents know/what they say
              about their knowledge is also considered when updating the Kripke model.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              2. Implementation of agents. Agents will use a random playing strategy to decide what their actions are
              (instead of the user inputing the events they see). The inferences are done in the same way as in the 1st
              stage. This results in a playable game against AI agents.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              3. More complex strategies for the agents might be implemented later. The rest remains the same.

            <p class="mb-4">The model’s foundation is a Kripke model that is shared among all agents. Naturally, the two
              main elements of the model are the worlds/states and the accessibility relations between states.<br>
              1. Worlds/States: Each world contains a set of atomic propositions. There are two types of propositions:
              1) Propositions describing what is in the hidden stack(e.g. “w_1” entails that weapon 1 is in the hidden
              stack) and 2) Propositions describing what is in agents’ hands (e.g. “c_{w_1}” entails agent c has weapon
              1)
              <br>
              2. Accessibility relations: As per usual, the accessibility relations model what each agent considers to
              be a possibility. Depending on the inference-capacity of each agent, different accessibility relations are
              removed/changed after every round.

            <p class="mb-4">We will use the MESA (for the MAS aspect) and MLSolver (for building and updating the Kripke
              model) packages. The solve function from the MLSolver function uses a function that generates the powerset
              of all worlds. As our model will contain a significant number of words, we need to code our own
              implementation of the function, as using the existing one is too computational expensive for our
              application (for more than a few worlds). As the user inputs the data, MESA will be used to track the
              game’s state and decide what information is needed next and in the event of user input we will update the
              kripke model through ml solver. At any point, the user will be able to query the ML solver model using
              epistemic logic formulae.
